### **Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of Omnivoy is to provide students with a tool that helps them prioritize their tasks based on deadlines and academic performance. The key objectives are as follows:

1. **Canvas Integration**: Develop a functional web application that retrieves assignment deadlines and grades from Canvas.
2. **Task Prioritization Algorithm**: Implement an intelligent prioritization algorithm to rank tasks by urgency, weight, and past performance.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an easy-to-use interface that allows students to quickly view and manage their academic tasks.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Provide real-time updates and notifications to keep students on track with their tasks.
5. **Usability Testing**: Conduct testing and gather feedback from students to refine the tool and improve its functionality and accuracy.
