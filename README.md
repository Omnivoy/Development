Justification
Omnivoy is designed to help students efficiently manage their academic tasks by integrating with the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). It aims to reduce the stress students face when juggling assignments and deadlines, enabling them to focus more on understanding course materials.

Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of Omnivoy is to provide students with a tool that helps them prioritize their tasks based on deadlines and academic performance. The key objectives are as follows:

Canvas Integration: Develop a functional web application that retrieves assignment deadlines and grades from Canvas.
Task Prioritization Algorithm: Implement an intelligent prioritization algorithm to rank tasks by urgency, weight, and past performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Create an easy-to-use interface that allows students to quickly view and manage their academic tasks.
Real-Time Updates: Provide real-time updates and notifications to keep students on track with their tasks.
Usability Testing: Conduct testing and gather feedback from students to refine the tool and improve its functionality and accuracy.
Stakeholders
Omnivoy (Software Development Team): The team responsible for developing and delivering the tool.
Prof. Zhao Han: The professor providing guidance and evaluating student progress throughout the project.
Students: The end users who will benefit from the tool to help prioritize their coursework and manage their assignments.
Milestones
February 2025: Finalize project plan and research Canvas API integration.
March 2025: Develop the backend using Ruby on Rails and implement the database structure.
Mid-March 2025: Develop the frontend interface using React.js and integrate it with the backend.
Late March 2025: Implement the prioritization algorithm and refine task ranking logic.
Early April 2025: Conduct usability testing, gather feedback, and make improvements.
April 20, 2025: Submit the final working version with documentation.
Deliverables
Documentation: Project reports, system architecture, API integration details, and user guides.
Working Software: A fully functional web application accessible via modern web browsers, integrated with Canvas for task prioritization and a clean, intuitive interface.
Constraints
Schedule: The project must be completed by April 20, 2025.
Economic: The project uses minimal funding, relying on free and open-source tools for development.
Cultural: The software should be accessible to students with diverse needs and varying levels of technical proficiency.
Legal: The application must comply with Canvas API terms of use and student data privacy regulations to ensure ethical handling of user information.
Non-Scope Tasks and Items
Omnivoy will not function as a standalone learning tool or tutoring service.
The application will not generate study materials or provide direct coursework assistance.
Omnivoy will not replace existing Canvas features like grade input or instructor communication.
Acceptance Criteria
